##  Verification Checklist

After setup, verify:

- [ ] GitHub Pages is deployed and accessible
- [ ] CI workflow runs on push/PR
- [ ] Branch protection prevents direct pushes to main
- [ ] Dependabot PRs are being created (check after a week)
- [ ] Coverage reports upload successfully
- [ ] All status checks appear in PRs
- [ ] Deployment workflow triggers on main merge
- [ ] Maintenance workflow runs weekly
- [ ] Issue templates appear when creating issues
- [ ] PR template appears when creating PRs

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### CI Workflows Not Running

1. Check **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Ensure Actions are enabled
3. Check workflow file syntax with `yamllint`

### GitHub Pages Not Deploying

1. Check **Settings** → **Pages** is configured
2. Ensure **Actions** have write permissions
3. Check workflow logs for errors

### Coverage Upload Failing

1. Verify `CODECOV_TOKEN` is set (if using Codecov)
2. Check codecov.io for errors
3. Ensure coverage files are generated

### Branch Protection Too Strict

1. Temporarily disable rules for testing
2. Re-enable after verification
3. Consider excluding administrators initially
