# CI/CD Quick Reference Card

##  Common Commands

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run tests with coverage
npm run test:coverage

# Run tests in CI mode
npm run test:ci

# Run tests in watch mode
npm run test:watch

# Validate everything
npm run validate
```

## 🌿 Branch Workflow

```bash
# Create feature branch
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Make changes, commit
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add my feature"

# Push (triggers CI)
git push origin feature/my-feature

# Create PR on GitHub
# → CI runs automatically
# → Review and merge
```

##  Release Workflow

```bash
# Option 1: Git tag
git tag -a v1.2.0 -m "Release v1.2.0"
git push origin v1.2.0

# Option 2: GitHub UI
# Actions → Release → Run workflow → Enter version
```

##  Check CI Status

```bash
# View on GitHub
https://github.com/vnicolas/TimeUp/actions

# View specific workflow
https://github.com/vnicolas/TimeUp/actions/workflows/ci.yml
```

##  Debugging CI Failures

1. Go to **Actions** tab
2. Click on failed workflow
3. Click on failed job
4. Expand failed step
5. Read error logs

##  Conventional Commits

```
feat: new feature
fix: bug fix
docs: documentation
style: formatting
refactor: code restructuring
test: test updates
chore: maintenance
perf: performance
```

##  Coverage Thresholds

```
Minimum required:
├── Statements: 90%
├── Branches:   90%
├── Functions:  90%
└── Lines:      90%

Current status:
├── Statements: 95.74% 
├── Branches:   91.38%

```

##  Workflow Triggers

| Workflow | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| CI | Push to any branch, PR to main/develop |
| Deploy | Push to main, manual |
| Maintenance | Mondays 9 AM UTC, manual |
| Release | Version tags (v*.*.*), manual |

##  Artifacts

| Artifact | Workflow | Location |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Coverage Report | CI | Actions → Workflow → Artifacts |
| Maintenance Report | Maintenance | Actions → Workflow → Artifacts |
| Coverage Trend | Maintenance | Actions → Workflow → Artifacts |
| Test Stability | Maintenance | Actions → Workflow → Artifacts |

## 🚨 Emergency Fixes

```bash
# Hotfix branch
git checkout main
git pull
git checkout -b hotfix/critical-issue

# Fix, commit, push
git add .
git commit -m "fix: critical issue"
git push origin hotfix/critical-issue

# Create PR to main
# → CI runs
# → Fast-track review
# → Merge to main
# → Auto-deploys
```

## 🔐 Required Checks

Before merge to main:
-  All tests pass
-  Coverage ≥90%
-  No console.log statements
-  JSON files valid
-  No security vulnerabilities
-  1 approval from code owner
