      <p class="privacy__updated">Last updated: January 29, 2026</p>

      <h2 class="privacy__section-title">Overview</h2>
      <p>
        TimeUp is a Trello Power-Up that provides time tracking functionality
        within Trello boards. This policy describes how TimeUp handles data.
      </p>

      <h2 class="privacy__section-title">No External Data Collection</h2>
      <p>
        TimeUp does not collect, transmit, or store any data on external
        servers. The Power-Up operates entirely within your browser and uses
        only Trello's built-in storage API. There are no analytics, tracking
        cookies, or third-party services.
      </p>

      <h2 class="privacy__section-title">Data Storage Within Trello</h2>
      <p>
        All data is stored using Trello's Power-Up storage system, which keeps
        data within your Trello workspace. The following information is stored:
      </p>

      <h3 class="privacy__subsection-title">
        Card-Level Data (Shared with all card members)
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Time entries:</strong> Start time, end time, duration, and
          optional descriptions
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Timer state:</strong> Whether a timer is currently running,
          paused, or idle
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Time estimates:</strong> Manual or calculated estimates for
          tasks
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Checklist item timers:</strong> Individual timer states for
          checklist items
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="privacy__subsection-title">
        Board-Level Settings (Shared across board)
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Hourly rate:</strong> Optional billing rate for reports</li>
        <li><strong>Currency:</strong> Display currency preference</li>
        <li><strong>Categories:</strong> Custom time entry categories</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="privacy__subsection-title">
        User-Level Preferences (Private to you)
      </h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Display format:</strong> Show seconds, 12/24-hour format
        </li>
        <li><strong>Behavior settings:</strong> Auto-start preferences</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="privacy__section-title">Trello API Access (Optional)</h2>
      <p>
        TimeUp requests optional <strong>Read-Only Access</strong> to your
        Trello boards via the Trello REST API. This authorization is used
        exclusively to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Fetch complete checklist item details (standard Power-Up API has
          limitations)
        </li>
        <li>Calculate progress based on checklist completion</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>You can decline this authorization</strong> and TimeUp will
        continue to work with basic checklist functionality. This access is
        read-only and does not modify your boards or cards.
      </p>

      <h2 class="privacy__section-title">Personal Information</h2>
      <p>
        TimeUp does not access, store, or process any personal identifying
        information such as names, email addresses, or contact details. All
        stored data consists solely of timestamps, durations, and user-provided
        task descriptions.
      </p>

      <h2 class="privacy__section-title">Data Deletion</h2>
      <p>
        To remove all TimeUp data from a card, simply delete the time entries
        within the Power-Up interface. To remove all data from a board, disable
        the TimeUp Power-Up from that board.
      </p>

        an updated revision date.
